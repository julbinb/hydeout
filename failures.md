**What is this?** A list of things that didn't work out for me.  
I will try to be honest and update this page with
research- and career-related failures as they happen.
The first version was written in 2020 from memory.

**Why is this?** To increase transparency, in the hope that this will
make failures more normal and less painful.  
<!--It is easy to get frustrated when your paper is rejected
or you don't get a job, especially when there is so much information
about other people's success out there. Failures are usually not as visible,
but they do happen, and they probably happen more often than not.
Joining the crowd of folks in academia who openly-->

**Note 1.** This page is inspired by Twitter conversations
about failures in academia
and [Ben Greenman]({{site.people.bengreenman}})'s CV of failures;
transitively inspired by
[Johannes Haushofer](https://haushofer.ne.su.se/)'s
[CV of failures](https://haushofer.ne.su.se/Johannes_Haushofer_CV_of_Failures.pdf).

**Note 2.** Many things that work out well involve a great deal of luck.
