### About

I received MS in Computer Science in 2014 from
[Southern Federal University](http://sfedu.ru/international/), Russia.
My master's thesis was about a model of concepts for a simple object-oriented
language (like C++ concepts or Haskell type classes).

In 2014–2016 I was teaching at the
[Faculty of Mathematics, Mechanics and Computer Science](http://mmcs.sfedu.ru/),
my alma mater. I absolutely love working with students
and teaching computer science.

### Research

Currently I work around the [Julia](https://julialang.org/) programming language.
