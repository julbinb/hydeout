I am a **PhD Student**
at the [Khoury College of Computer Sciences](https://www.khoury.northeastern.edu/),
[Northeastern University](https://www.northeastern.edu/) (Boston, MA, USA)
since September 2018.

I work with [Jan Vitek]({{site.people.jan}})
in the Programming Research Laboratory ([PRL](http://prl.ccs.neu.edu)).  
{% include jump-button.html link="#research" name="the Research section" %}

My primary research interests are **programming languages** and **type theory**.
I also like theorem proving (most of my experience has been with
[The Coq Proof Assistant](https://coq.inria.fr/)),
generic programming (like Java generics or ML polymorphism),
functional and object-oriented programming,
software engineering, programming by contracts, and software testing.
Lately, I have been getting interested in human aspects of software
engineering and the interaction between humans and programming languages.

### Short bio

I was born in 1991 in Russia, Rostov-on-Don, where I also grew up
and received education.
In 2012–2016, I was teaching undergraduate CS courses at my alma mater,
[Faculty of Mathematics, Mechanics and Computer Science](http://mmcs.sfedu.ru/)
([Southern Federal University](http://sfedu.ru/international/)).  
While teaching half-time, I had entered a PhD program as well
but later moved to [Northeastern](https://www.northeastern.edu/)
where my PhD journey started over.  
In 2017–2018, I spent a year at the
[Faculty of Information Technology](https://www.fit.cvut.cz/en)
([Czech Technical University in Prague](https://www.cvut.cz/en)) doing research
with [Jan Vitek](http://janvitek.org/).  
Since 2018, I have been doing my PhD in Boston.

**Education.** MS in "Computer Science and Information Technologies"
from [Southern Federal University](http://sfedu.ru/international/).

*Note.* If you have questions about doing a PhD in the US,
being an international student or a woman in CS, feel free to send me an email.

Currently, I work on formalizing various aspects of the
[Julia programming language](https://julialang.org/):

* Semantics of `eval` and [world age](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/methods/#Redefining-Methods).
* Subtyping relation: I have been developing a semantic subtyping model
  suitable for a dynamic language.

_Disclaimer._ Good or bad, the language has nothing to do with me, and the name match is a coincidence!

My previous research was related to language support for generic programming
in object-oriented languages.
