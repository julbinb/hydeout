I am a researcher
at the [Faculty of Information Technology](https://www.fit.cvut.cz/en),
[Czech Technical University in Prague](https://www.cvut.cz/en) (FIT CVUT)
since September 2017.

My primary research interests are programming languages and type theory.
I am also fond of theorem proving (Coq),
generic programming (like Java generics or ML polymorphism),
object-oriented and functional programming,
software engineering, programming by contracts, software testing.

I was born and grew up in Russia, Rostov-on-Don.
In 2014 I received MS in "Computer Science and Information Technologies"
from [Southern Federal University](http://sfedu.ru/international/).
For several years I had been happily teaching at the
[Faculty of Mathematics, Mechanics and Computer Science](http://mmcs.sfedu.ru/),
my alma mater.

I like taking pictures but never have time to filter and publish them.

## Research

Currently I work around the [Julia](https://julialang.org/) programming language.

My previous research was related to language support for generic programming
in object-oriented languages.

   {% capture text-capture %} Earlier comparative studies of language support for generic 
   programming (GP) have shown that mainstream object-oriented (OO) 
   languages such as C# and Java provide weaker support for GP 
   as compared with functional languages such as Haskell or SML. 
   But many new object-oriented languages have appeared in recent years. 
   Have they improved the support for generic programming? And if not, 
   is there a reason why OO languages yield to functional ones in this 
   respect? In this paper we analyse language constructs for GP in 
   seven modern object-oriented languages. We demonstrate that all of 
   these languages follow the same approach to constraining type 
   parameters, which has a number of inevitable problems. However, 
   those problems are successfully lifted with the use of the another 
   approach. Several language extensions that adopt this approach and 
   allow to improve GP in OO languages are considered. We analyse the 
   dependencies between different language features, discuss the 
   features’ support using both approaches, and propose which approach 
   is more expressive. {% endcapture %}
