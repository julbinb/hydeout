I am a PhD Student
at the [Khoury College of Computer Sciences](https://www.khoury.northeastern.edu/),
[Northeastern University](https://www.northeastern.edu/) (Khoury NEU), Boston, MA, USA
since September 2018.
I work with Professor [Jan Vitek](http://janvitek.org/).

My primary research interests are programming languages and type theory.
I am also fond of theorem proving (Coq),
generic programming (like Java generics or ML polymorphism),
object-oriented and functional programming,
software engineering, programming by contracts, software testing.

I was born and grew up in Russia, Rostov-on-Don.
In 2014 I received MS in "Computer Science and Information Technologies"
from [Southern Federal University](http://sfedu.ru/international/).
For several years I had been happily teaching at the
[Faculty of Mathematics, Mechanics and Computer Science](http://mmcs.sfedu.ru/),
my alma mater.
In 2017â€“2018 I worked as a researcher
at the [Faculty of Information Technology](https://www.fit.cvut.cz/en),
[Czech Technical University in Prague](https://www.cvut.cz/en) (FIT CVUT).

## Research

Currently, I work around subtyping relation in the [Julia](https://julialang.org/) programming language.
_Disclaimer._ Good or bad, the language has nothing to do with me, and the name match is a coincidence!

My previous research was related to language support for generic programming
in object-oriented languages.
