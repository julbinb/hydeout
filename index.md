I am a researcher
at the [Faculty of Information Technology](https://www.fit.cvut.cz/en),
[Czech Technical University in Prague](https://www.cvut.cz/en) (FIT CVUT)
since September 2017.

My primary research interests are programming languages and type theory.
I also like theorem proving (Coq),
generic programming (like Java generics or ML polymorphism),
functional programming,
programming by contracts, and testing.

I was born and grew up in Russia, Rostov-on-Don.
In 2014 I received MS in "Computer Science and Information Technologies"
from [Southern Federal University](http://sfedu.ru/international/).
For several years I was happily teaching at the
[Faculty of Mathematics, Mechanics and Computer Science](http://mmcs.sfedu.ru/),
my alma mater.

I like taking pictures but never have time to filter and publish them.

### Research

Currently I work around the [Julia](https://julialang.org/) programming language.

My previous research was related to language support for generic programming
in object-oriented languages.
