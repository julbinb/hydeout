  Hey there! This page is included as an example.

I was born and grew up in Russia, [Rostov-on-Don](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rostov-on-Don).

I received MS in Computer Science in 2014 from
[Southern Federal University](http://sfedu.ru/international/), Russia.
My master's thesis was about a model of concepts
(like C++ concepts or Haskell type classes)
for a simple object-oriented language.

In 2014â€“2016 I was teaching at the
[Faculty of Mathematics, Mechanics and Computer Science](http://mmcs.sfedu.ru/).
