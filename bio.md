I was born in 1991 in the city of [Rostov-on-Don](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rostov-on-Don), Russia. There, I grew up and spent most of my life.

In September 2018, I started PhD in Computer Science at [Northeastern University](http://www.northeastern.edu/), and I have been living in Boston since then.

My actual name is Юлия, transliterated as Yulia. I have been using Julia as my professional name because it seems easier to pronounce, but I equally like both.

## Education

I received both BS and MS from the [Southern Federal University](http://sfedu.ru/international/) (former Rostov State University), Rostov-on-Don, Russia.
My department, [Faculty of Mathematics, Mechanics and Computer Science (MMCS)](http://mmcs.sfedu.ru/), is now called [I. I. Vorovich Institute for Mathematics, Mechanics and Computer Science](http://mmcs.sfedu.ru/).

#### MS in Computer Science (2012–2014)
